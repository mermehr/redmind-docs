# Month 04 Summary: September 2025

**Period:** 2025-09-01 → 2025-09-28

## Red Team Progress

### HTB Academy
- **Metasploit Framework** — Completed. Deepened understanding of exploit configuration, payload options, session handling, and MSF database workflows.
- **Password Attacks** — Completed. Intensive module covering local and remote cracking, credential harvesting, cracking protected archives, and credential-based lateral movement techniques. Produced portable playbooks and extended notes for repeatable workflows.
- **Windows Command Line** — Completed. Targeted remediation of PowerShell/CLI weak spots used in both offensive and defensive tasks.
- **Attacking Common Services** — Completed. Focused on non-web services (FTP, SMB, mail, databases) and common misconfiguration patterns that lead to credential leaks, RCE, and privilege escalation.

### HTB Engagements
- Boxes completed: **Union**, **Soccer**, **Access**, **Jerry (rework)**, **Delivery**, **Devel**.
- Hands-on lessons: simple misconfigurations and stored credentials are frequently the fastest path to a foothold; careful, methodical enumeration often reveals the overlooked artifacts that automated tools miss.
- Ancillary work: forensics and web challenge notes consolidated to broaden practical exposure.

## Python Development
- Continued offensive scripting from *Black Hat Python*: `icmp_sniffer.py`, `udp_icmp_scanner.py` for low-level host discovery and packet inspection.
- Small projects and practice utilities: `ying_yang.py` (logic puzzle), plus a creative detour — a small **pygame** starter (inspired by *Book of the Fallen*) to reinforce OOP and maintain momentum: `main.py`, `level.py`, `player.py`.
- Goal: keep daily practice focused on building repeatable, testable scripts that can be re-used during engagements.

---

## Tooling & Workflow
- Shell environment: migrated from **bash** to **zsh**, porting helpers and improving shell UX.
- Cheatsheets & playbooks created or expanded:
  - `grep | awk | sed | sort` pipeline cheatsheet
  - Password cracking wordlists & Hashcat command references
  - Persistence & post‑exploitation playbooks for Windows and Linux
- Process: snapshot-first approach for risky actions; documented VM snapshot & disk-image attack concepts under *Post-Exploitation/Data-Hunting*.
- Documenting intuition: added a habit of logging small, “looks off” observations during enumeration for later correlation.

---

## Key Takeaways
- September transitioned from foundational enumeration to multi-stage exploitation and persistence.
- Completing *Password Attacks* was a major milestone; required patience and produced reusable playbooks.
- Many compromises arise from simple mistakes — weak credentials, misplaced config files, or forgotten artifacts — not always exotic zero-days.
- Balancing offensive study with creative Python projects helped prevent fatigue and improved code structuring skills.
- Workflow improvements (zsh, cheatsheets, playbooks) materially reduced friction during hands-on practice.

## Next Steps (Short‑to‑Mid Term)
1. Start **Pivoting, Tunneling & Port Forwarding** (HTB Academy) to improve lateral movement toolset.
2. Refresh **bash** scripting with pentest‑oriented tasks and automate common enumeration steps.
3. Continue focused HTB practice with an emphasis on service exploitation and Active Directory scenarios (AD enumeration, CrackMapExec, BloodHound workflows).
4. Advance Python projects toward small offensive tooling helpers (modular, tested, and documented).
5. Maintain CCNA lab refreshers to keep networking fundamentals sharp.
