# Month 03 Summary: August 2025

## Red Team Progress

### HTB Academy
- **Penetration Testing Process** completed, covering the lifecycle from contracts to reporting, plus practical tooling and OSINT.  
- **Enumeration with Nmap** completed: host discovery, service detection, OS fingerprinting, evasion, and lab challenges.  
- **Footprinting module** completed, including enumeration across FTP, SMB, NFS, DNS, SMTP, IMAP/POP3, SNMP, MySQL, MSSQL, and IPMI. Produced independent reports for Easy, Medium, and Hard scenarios.  
- **Information Gathering – Web Edition** and **Vulnerability Assessment** completed with assessments via Nessus and OpenVAS.  
- **File Transfer** module completed (Linux & Windows), strengthening practical file movement and evasion.  
- **Shells & Payloads** module completed, including bind vs reverse shells, MSFvenom, Metasploit usage, shell spawning methods, detection and prevention tactics.  

### HTB Engagements
- Revisited **Nibbles** pre-Academy for reinforcement, chaining enumeration → exploitation → privilege escalation.  
- Returned to the **Forest** box with IppSec’s walkthrough, gaining deeper insights into Active Directory enumeration and CrackMapExec tooling.  
- Live engagement practice on file transfer and shells/payloads modules.  
- Practiced unguided labs to reinforce methodology and build reporting skills.

## Python Development

### Automate the Boring Stuff (ATBS)
- ✅ Completed Chapters 12–16 (Command Line Programs, Web Scraping, SQL Databases).  
- Scripts created: `daily_journal.py`, `fishtank.py`, `snowstorm.py`, `showmap.py`, weather API fetcher.  
- Practiced packaging/distribution with PyInstaller and resolved library compatibility issues.  
- Concluded ATBS journey mid-month, shifting into offensive Python.  

### Black Hat Python
- Advanced through Chapter 2:  
  - Built TCP/UDP clients, TCP server, netcat replacement (`netcat.py`), and TCP proxy (`proxy.py`).  
  - Developed SSH tooling with Paramiko (`ssh_cmd.py`, `ssh_rcmd.py`, `ssh_server.py`).  
- Explored staged vs stageless payloads, clarified exploitation concepts.  
- Gained deeper understanding of `socket`, `argparse`, and `subprocess`.  

---

## Bash & Workflow
- Refreshed on **tmux** and **vim**, integrated into daily workflow.  
- Built new bash utilities for logging and project management:  
  - `scratchpad`, `scratch_snap`, `logcmd`, `lg`, `lecho`  
  - **Scratchpad Manager** script for pentest project tracking with screenshot integration.  
- Migrated and cleaned notes into VS Code; evaluated Typora, Obsidian, and Zettlr but reinforced a lightweight, script-driven workflow.  
- Consolidated logs and reports into GitHub repos.  

---

## Key Takeaways
- Marked transition from **learning Python basics** (ATBS) to **building offensive tooling** (Black Hat Python).  
- Major HTB Academy milestones completed (Enumeration, Footprinting, File Transfer, Shells & Payloads).  
- Workflow automation is reducing friction and improving clarity in study and practice.  
- Growing confidence in recognizing vulnerabilities intuitively during live engagements.  
- Stronger operational grasp of Windows/Linux exploitation and Active Directory enumeration.  

---

## Next Steps
- Advance deeper into *Black Hat Python* beyond Chapter 2.  
- Apply new payload/shell knowledge on more HTB boxes outside Academy.  
- Explore Netmiko as a possible alternative to Paramiko.  
- Continue refining workflow tooling to streamline reporting and engagement capture.  
- Strengthen AD/Windows exploitation stack (CrackMapExec, BloodHound).
