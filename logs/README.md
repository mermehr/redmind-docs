# Red Team Learning Log

This folder contains my red team learning progression, structured weekly and daily for accountability, review, and knowledge reinforcement.

## Structure

**`summary-pre-log.md`**

Overview of foundational skills, certifications, and the pivot to red teaming prior to June 13, 2025.

**`daily/`**

Daily breakdowns of learning activity â€” Python progress, HTB engagements, study notes, tooling insights.

**`weekly/` | `monthly/`**

Summarized, high-level overviews of weekly/monthly progress. Useful for quick review, interviews, or journaling retrospectives.

## Purpose

This learning log serves as a timeline of technical development â€” documenting:

- Hands-on red team practice
- Python scripting for offense
- Enumeration and exploitation workflows
- Study milestones (OSCP, ATBS, HTB, etc.)
