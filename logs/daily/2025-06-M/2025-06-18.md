### Completed Tasks

OSINT - Ethical Hacking
* Worked on Cisco's ethical hacking courseware
* Did some footprining and recon practice
* Linked up with some "other" resources

Refined my Python development environment
* Unified scripting and journaling workflows into one workspace
* Autosave and Git sync functioning as intended

Maintained structured learning
* Focused more on logic building and workflow clarity than volume
* Skipped through lower-value material, filtering better signal from noise

Prepped for upcoming labs and practical recon
* Took mental notes on what kind of work excites me most—more analysis and infiltration angles than pure exploitation
* Tomorrow I’ll check out some alternate sources for red team insight
