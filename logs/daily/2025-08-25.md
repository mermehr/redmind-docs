## HTB Academy

**Challenges:**

- Get flag.txt from server, upload to and hash provided file to server. - *Done*
- Optional: Practice various file transfer methods on target - *Done*

**Penetration Tester Pathway:**

- ***Module - File Transfers*** 
  - Windows File Transfer Methods

### Tools / Resource(s) Used

- [SeImpersonatePrivilege](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/windows-security/seimpersonateprivilege-secreateglobalprivilege), [PrintSpoofer](https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer), [certutil](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/certutil), [smbserver](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbserver.py)
- `smbserver.py`, `pyftpdlib`, `uploadserver`, `wsgidav`

### HTB Notes:

I took a lot longer on this sub-module that was probably necessary as Windows my windows pentest skills are on a bit of the shallow side, good way to bump them up.

Had successes with transfer files using the base64 method, impacket-smbserver and pyftpdlib. However, I could not get python `uploaderserver` or the `wsgidav` method to work. Possibly outdated material as both of those methods were reporting syntax errors and I unfortunately don't have the time to research them.

## Python

**Black Hat Python:**

- ***Chapter 2***
- Building a TCP Proxy
  - Project complete

**Scripts:** `proxy.py`

>Capable of forwarding traffic to bounce from host to host, or when assessing network-based software. When performing penetration tests in enterprise environments, you probably wonâ€™t be able to run Wireshark; nor will you be able to load drivers to sniff the loopback on Windows, and network
>segmentation will prevent you from running your tools directly against your
>target host.

### Tools / Resource(s) Used

- [Python.org /Lib/socket](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html)
### Python Notes:

Interesting project, got me more familiar with the socket module in python.
