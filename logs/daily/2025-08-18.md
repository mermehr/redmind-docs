**Focus Areas**: Getting Organized

## Notes 

Reorganized and migrated notes to VS Code. Cleaned up CTF reports and log entries.

I attempted to find a reasonable note-taking application, but that search failed. Cherrytree is okay, but it lacks Markdown, plugin support, and cloud backup. Obsidian would have been the next best option, but the GitHub support and UI feel janky. And god forbid you mix a Python script in there—once you finally get Git set up on Linux, it will encode line endings in your script even if they’re just sitting in an assets folder. As for Joplin, well, that one’s baked.

So I’ll just stick with Xed, VS Code, and custom scripts to tie it all together. Works better that way for me.
