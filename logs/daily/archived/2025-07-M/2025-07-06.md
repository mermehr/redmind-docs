## 🐍 Python Practice

- Completed Part 3, Section 2 of the MOOC – string handling and slicing logic.
- Practiced structured input validation and controlled while loop usage.
- Built a basic CLI port analysis script using conditionals and return flags.
- Reinforced Python's substring logic, including safe slice boundaries.

## Takeaways

- Python allows slicing beyond the end of a string without crashing — unlike C-style indexing.
- Avoiding premature abstraction (like using lists or functions) often leads to simpler, more stable early solutions.
- Coming from C# or structured environments makes it easy to overbuild — but Python rewards minimalism and trust in its core features.
