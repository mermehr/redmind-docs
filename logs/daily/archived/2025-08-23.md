**Focus Areas**: HTB, Python

## HTB Academy

**Target Box:**

- ***Forest - Returned***

### Tools / Resource(s) Used

- [IppSec - Forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9FcE_FMZio&list=PLidcsTyj9JXItWpbRtTg6aDEj10_F17x5)

### HTB Notes

Did the Forest box again today after watching IppSec's video. It gave me a much more in-depth perspective on approaching Windows/AD enumeration and attack surface, along with some other tools I should leverage and learn that the Pentester pathway doesn’t cover, CrackMapExec in particular. It was also interesting to see the different tools he uses, since they’re typically not mentioned in other guides or on Academy so far. His environment setup is very similar to mine, which is good to know I got right.

## Python

**Black Hat Python:**

- ***Chapter 2***
- Building a TCP Proxy
  - Started work on python `proxy.py` server

### Python Notes

> When performing penetration tests in enter-
> prise environments, you probably won’t be able to run Wireshark; nor will
> you be able to load drivers to sniff the loopback on Windows, and network
> segmentation will prevent you from running your tools directly against your
> target host. We’ve built simple Python proxies, like this one, in various cases
> to help you understand unknown protocols, modify traffic being sent to an
> application, and create test cases for fuzzers.
