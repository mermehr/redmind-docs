## HTB Academy

**Challenges:**

- DNS/Subdomain/vHost enumeration

**Penetration Tester Pathway:**

- Module: Information Gathering - Web Edition
  - WHOIS
  - DNS
  - DNS & Subdomains

## Python

**Black Hat Python:**

- Chapter: 2 - Basic Networking Tools
  - TCP Server
  - Replacing Netcat
- New python modules
  - subprocess
  - argparse

**Scripts:**

- `tcp_client`, `udp_client`, `tcp_server.py`

## Challenges Faced

While testing the first TCP client/server exercise from *Black Hat Python*, I ran into a mismatch in the example code where the server thread was started with `client_handler` but the function was actually defined as `handle_client`. This prevented the handler from running until corrected. Once fixed, the client and server communicated as expected on localhost, confirming that the issue was with the code example rather than the firewall or environment. A good reminder to double-check function names in the bookâ€™s examples.
