## Notes

While Playwright seems to be the better option of the two browser-based scraping modules for Python, I can’t see myself using either of them unless I wanted to create some automation or plugins with GreaseMonkey or something similar. It’s good information to know that these modules exist, as I may use them in the future. I did not complete the practice programs section in this chapter, as they are arbitrary and provide me with no real benefit.

Nice refresh and information for enumerating SMB servers, admittedly I haven't been the best withSMB enumeration as most information out there is basically copy and pasting commands. This solidified the processes, which is good.
