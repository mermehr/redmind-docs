### Completed Tasks

Python – MOOC 2025
* Continued from previous day, completed the first section
* Heavy focus on math-based scripting, function logic, and general control flow
* Work was repetitive but helped reestablish fluency in basic Python structure

Cisco Ethical Hacker – Module 4
* Worked through most of the module
* Topics included social engineering tactics and spoofing methods
* Tools touched: SET, BeEF, spoofapp/spoofcard
* Minimal learning gain due to heavy overlap with college training
* Treated as a tactical refresh rather than a deep dive

Scene Research – Legacy Platforms
* Explored HackThisSite, HBH.sh, and similar resources
* Research focus: mapping the shift and decline of pre-2022 hacking spaces
* Clarified current training landscape and affirmed HTB as go-to platform

Hack The Box
* Skipped for now – deferred due to time and shifting focus
