### Notes

Spent the evening consolidating notes and wiring up my workflow. I set up a couple of bash scripts `scratchpad` and set daily init, `scratch_snap` for saving Flameshot snips to ./screens/, and bash helpers (logcmd, lg, lecho) that append commands, outputs, and quick notes to a single ./logs/ ledger per day. Standardized the daily layout under ~/scratchpad/MM-DD-YY/ with assets/, screens/, and logs/, and pointed Typora at the current scratch so it opens automatically. The goal is to kill the copy-paste grind, cut context switching, and capture as I go. The logging chaos was really starting to piss me off; this pass should calm it down. Iâ€™ll run it on the next HTB session and do a Sunday cleanup to promote anything worth keeping.
