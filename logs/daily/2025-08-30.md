## HTB Academy

**Challenges:**

- [Live Engagement](../../boxes/htb-academy/Shells&Payloads/Live-Engagement.md)

**Penetration Tester Pathway:**

- ***Module - Shells & Payloads*** - Complete
  
  - Established an understanding of the difference between `Bind` & `Reverse` shells
  - Experimented with common `one-liners` and studied them at a detailed level
  - Used `Metasploit` to deploy a `payload` and establish a shell session
  - Used `MSFvenom` to craft a payload
  - Identified various methods of `spawning interactive shells`
  - Experimented with various methods of gaining `web` shell sessions on web servers
  - Applied an `enumeration methodology` to identify payloads & shells that would be useful in different situations
  - Explored `detection` and `prevention` techniques
  
  >This module covered the basics of shells & payloads, ways to  transfer & execute payloads to gain a shell on Windows & Linux  systems. It introduced detection & prevention methods that can be  implemented in any network environment.

## Tools / Resource(s) Used

- `msfconsole`, `msvenom`
