## Notes

#### Python

Engineers from what I've read rant negatively about Paramiko but strongly recommend Netmiko. If I run into any issues, I'll be sure to look into that fork.

#### HTB

Found an excellent write-up, [hear](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2015/03/25/stageless-meterpreter-payloads/) specifically explaining the difference between a staged and stage-less payloads. This is something that frequently bothered me in the past. It is honestly the complete opposite of the term I thought it meant as both have proven to work, however I've only used them on local and test machines, not in any real world situation.
