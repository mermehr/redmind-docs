## HTB Academy

**Penetration Tester Pathway:**

- ***Module -  File Transfer*** - Complete

- ##### Conclusion

  This module covered methods for transferring  files to and from Linux and Windows systems using built-in operating  system tools, using both unstealthy and stealthy techniques. We  completed various exercises to reinforce the various topics introduced  throughout the module.

  **Module Key Takeaways**

  - File transfer methods using tools such as `PowerShell`, `Bitsadmin`, `Cerutil`, `Wget`, `cURL`, and more
  - Performing file transfers using scripting and compiled languages such as PHP, Python, Ruby, Perl, and Golang
  - Transfering files using web servers and protocols such as SMB, SCP, FTP, TFTP, and RDP
  - Common file transfer detection methods
  - Tactics for evading detection when performing file transfers

### Tools / Resource(s) Used

- `powershell`, `python`, `nc`, `wget`, `curl`, `xfreerdp`, `sshd`

### HTB Notes

Heck of a lot of information, managed to make a ton of useful notes on file transferring for Linux and Windows. This module was ladled as `medim`, not sure why that was, or I just found the challenges easy.

## Bash

**Scripts:**

- [Scratchpad Manager](https://github.com/mermehr/redmind-scripts/tree/main/reporting_tools/scratchpad_manager/scratchpad.sh)


## Bash Notes

Made a simple **bash-based project scratchpad manager** for red team pentest workflow. Keeps projects organised, tracks the current active workspace with a symlink, and integrates screenshots directly into notes.

Good for studying modules, boxes and managing projects in general.
