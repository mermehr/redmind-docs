## Learning Log â€“ 2025-07-13

**Focus Areas**: Python (ATBS), IDE Workflow, Debugging, Exception Handling

---

### Today's Progress

- Skimmed through ATBS **Chapter 4** and **Chapter 5**.
  - Explored `try` and `except` blocks â€” a topic that was not covered in the MOOC.
  - Worked through `time` module examples and related practice problems.
- Switched back to **PyCharm** from VS Code as the primary IDE.
  - Chapter 5 focused on Mu Editor, but I prefer PyCharm's feature set.
- Completed JetBrainsâ€™ official walkthrough for PyCharmâ€™s debugger:
  - ðŸ”— [Debugging Your First Python Application](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/debugging-your-first-python-application.html#summary)
  - Learned breakpoint setup, stepping through code, and variable inspection â€” highly effective use of time.

### Challenges Faced

- Found VS Code to just seem to bloated and pushy with extensions, so I switched back to PyCharm as it's a cleaner and more stable environment.

---

### Wins

- First meaningful use of structured exception handling in practice (`try/except`).
- Successfully worked through all time-based exercises without issue.
- Deepened confidence in navigating PyCharmâ€™s debugging tools.
- Reinforced my decision to move away from VS Code â€” workflow now feels smoother and more enjoyable.

---

### Concepts Reinforced

- Structured exception handling for better error management in scripts.
- Time delays and scheduling via the `time` module.
- Modern debugging flow inside a full-featured IDE (PyCharm).
- Reinforced that tool enjoyment boosts learning speed and retention.

### Tools / Resource(s) Used

- [ATBS â€” Automate the Boring Stuff with Python]
- PyCharm IDE
- JetBrains Debugging Guide

---

### Reflection / Notes to Self

- Debugging is going to be critical for red team scripting â€” glad Iâ€™m picking it up early.
- The `try`/`except` blocks are going to be useful in automation scripts, especially when chaining tools or parsing unreliable input.

### Tomorrow's Goals

- Begin HTB: **Forest** (final target in this weekâ€™s set).
- Read OSCP Bible sections relevant to Forest.
- Continue ATBS into Chapter 6, with at least one self-written automation snippet using exception handling.
