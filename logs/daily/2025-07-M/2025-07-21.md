## Red Team – Hack The Box: Cap

Today’s focus was on completing the HTB box "Cap". This engagement centered on identifying and exploiting insecure web logic and leveraging Linux capabilities for privilege escalation.

**Key Progress:**
- Identified an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability to download unauthorized packet capture files.
- Analyzed `.pcap` data in Wireshark to extract FTP credentials in plaintext.
- Gained initial access via FTP, followed by SSH login with the same credentials.
- Used `LinPEAS` to discover a Python binary with elevated Linux capabilities (`cap_setuid`), enabling a direct privilege escalation path to root.

**Tools Used:**
- Nmap (Full TCP, service enumeration, vuln scan)
- Wireshark (packet analysis)
- LinPEAS (privilege escalation enumeration)
- Standard utilities: `ftp`, `ssh`, `python3`

**Skills Practiced:**
- IDOR discovery and exploitation
- Packet capture analysis for credential harvesting
- Privilege escalation via Linux capabilities

## Python – Automate the Boring Stuff: Chapter 8 Completed

No reading from PWK was needed today due to the applied HTB activity. Instead, time was invested into completing **Chapter 8** of *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python*, which covered string manipulation and practical projects.

**Practice Programs Completed:**

### 1. Pig Latin Translator (`pigLat.py`)
- Converts English sentences to Pig Latin.
- Handles punctuation, case sensitivity, and non-letter characters.
- Demonstrates usage of string operations, conditionals, loops, and list building.

### 2. Table Printer (`tablePrinter.py`)
- Displays a list of lists as a cleanly formatted, column-aligned table.
- Uses dynamic column width calculation and string justification.
- Reinforced nested list access, loop control, and formatting logic.

**Notable Concepts Reviewed:**
- String manipulation and case handling
- Nested loops and list traversal
- Input processing and formatting
- Custom function design and modular code structure

## Reflections

Solid progress across both Python and red team practice today. The HTB Cap box was a realistic scenario combining passive credential discovery with a Linux privilege escalation trick that reinforces the need to understand post-exploitation enumeration. On the scripting side, creative text transformation and dynamic formatting showed practical applications of Python basics in a way that aligns nicely with future automation goals.
