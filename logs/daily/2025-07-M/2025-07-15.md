## Focus Areas
- HTB: Forest (Windows Active Directory lab)
- Python Practice
- ATBS Chapter 6 (continued)

## Red Team Progress – HTB: Forest

### **Box Summary**
- Completed **Forest**, a well-known HTB Windows box rooted in realistic **Active Directory infrastructure**.
- Applied everything from PWK Chapter 21–22 into a real-world sim: **kerberoasting**, **AD enumeration**, **BloodHound mapping**, and **privilege escalation**.

### **Engagement Flow**
- Started with **enum4linux** and **rpcclient** to pull user and group data from exposed SMB shares.
- Used **ldapsearch** and **bloodhound-python** to map trust paths and account permissions.
- Identified a **Kerberoastable user**, extracted TGS hashes using **Rubeus**, and cracked them locally with `hashcat`.
- Pivoted to **privilege escalation** via **group membership abuse**, leading to full domain admin access.

---

## Python Practice – ATBS Chapter 6 (Continued)

- Brief coding session to reinforce:
  - **Tuple unpacking**
  - Use of `enumerate()` in loops
  - List slicing and combining
- Notably light session, but enough to keep your Python neurons firing during a cognitively heavy red team day.

---

## Concepts Reinforced
- Full attack lifecycle against Active Directory: from reconnaissance to domain escalation.
- Practical workflow of **Kerberos abuse**, including **TGS ticket extraction** and post-crack exploitation.
- Realized value of BloodHound in mapping effective attack paths from noisy enumeration data.
- Use of PowerShell and Rubeus in authentic red team tactics against Windows infrastructure.

---

## Challenges Faced
- Seizures disrupted clarity and short-term memory; required significant re-referencing of notes and tools.
- Encountered troubleshooting friction with Windows tooling, credential exports, and syntax issues in Rubeus — slowed down the overall pace.

---

## Wins
- Completed **Forest** end-to-end — a major confidence checkpoint.
- Bridged theoretical knowledge from PWK with hands-on success.
- Handled a Windows box under cognitive strain — still delivered.
- Maintained Python touchpoint even in a red team-heavy workflow.

---

## Tools & Resources
- **enum4linux**, **rpcclient**
- **ldapsearch**
- **BloodHound + SharpHound**
- **Rubeus**
- **hashcat**
- **ATBS – Automate the Boring Stuff with Python**

---

## Tomorrow’s Objectives
- **Rest and recover** — skipping July 16 log as planned.
