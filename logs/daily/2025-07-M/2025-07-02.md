## üîß Red Team Activities
- Completed **HTB: Lame**
  - Enumeration via `nmap`, `smbmap`, and `smbclient`
  - Identified vulnerable Samba version (3.0.20) and exploited with Metasploit (CVE-2007-2447)
  - Verified root access and captured both user and root flags
  - Confirmed vsftpd backdoor unexploitable due to firewall
  - Performed additional recon using Metasploit modules per PWK guidance
  - Investigated SSH and scanned for other potential vulns (none found)
  - Launched **DVWS Docker container** and briefly reviewed it for future analysis

## üìò Study Progress
- **PWK Book** read up to ~page **680**
  - Found strong alignment between material and HTB: Lame
- **100 Days of Code ‚Äì Day 4**
  - Focused on practical Python functions for immediate use
  - Paid course, jumping between this and MOOC as needed
- **MOOC Python practice**
  - Light exercises completed alongside structured 100 Days of Code work

## üõ†Ô∏è Tooling & System Maintenance
- Minor tooling adjustments to improve workflow
- No major system changes

## ‚úÖ Summary
Solid day with strong overlap between practical hands-on exploitation and course theory. Maintaining a hybrid study model between Python MOOC and 100 Days of Code. HTB progress continues effectively with daily logging integrated.
