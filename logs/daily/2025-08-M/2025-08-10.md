## Notes

HTB Academy sections were mainly on nmap scanning. They went into a bit more detail on the different types of scans and when to use them. Other than that, pretty standard. One other thing that stood out was the very small mention of SCTP, which is a protocol most people are unaware of.

Got really tired of making a new journal entry file every day and having to navigate and open it, so I created a script to parse and update a template file and automatically add the dates, rename it, and dump it in my journal folder if it doesn't exist; if it exists, the script will just open the existing file. I shared it in my Python repo.
