## Tooling & Workflow

- Compiled notes on Windows and Linux persistence methods. These will be useful for both lab work and practical preparation before reaching the persistence section in CPTS.

------

## Observations & Lessons Learned

- Reinforced the importance of persistence techniques across both Windows and Linux platforms.
- Password Attacks module emphasized how critical proper credential handling is in both offensive and defensive contexts.
- Access box highlighted how simple misconfigurations and weak credentials can open the door to full system compromise.
- Continued focus on refining enumeration processes and capturing intuition-based observations (‚Äúsomething looks off‚Äù) to identify vulnerabilities.

## Knowledge & Skill Development

### Hack The Box

#### Academy ‚Äì *Password Attacks (Complete)*

This module covered the fundamental concepts behind various password attacks ‚Äî essential techniques for gaining initial access and escalating privileges during penetration testing.

**Module Key Takeaways:**

- Remote Password Attacks
- Local Password Attacks (Linux & Windows)
- Credential Hunting
- Password Cracking
- Cracking Password-Protected Files

**Notes:**
 This was one of the most demanding modules so far. It started slow but ramped up quickly into near course-level depth. The final sections were particularly challenging, requiring significant persistence. I produced extensive notes and created portable playbooks from earlier challenges, which helped compensate for limited prior exposure to some tools and techniques.

------

#### HTB ‚Äì Access (Complete)

A Windows-based machine centered around misconfigured services and weak credential storage.

- **Initial Access:** Exploited exposed files and services to recover credentials, which granted a foothold.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Required thorough enumeration of stored data and misconfigurations to move from user to Administrator.

This box reinforced the value of meticulous enumeration and persistence when privilege escalation paths are not immediately obvious.

------

#### Academy Module ‚Äì *Windows Command Line (In-progress)*

Acknowledging that PowerShell is a weak spot, I started this module as supplemental training. The goal is to strengthen Windows command line and PowerShell proficiency for both offensive and defensive tasks.

------

### Python

#### Book of the Fallen ‚Äì *pygame project*

Decided to take a creative detour to build confidence and reinforce Python fundamentals outside of security tooling. Initialized a new repo with functional starter scripts for a small game inspired by the *Malazan Book of the Fallen* series.

**Scripts Produced:** `main.py`, `level.py`, `player.py`

This side project provides a fun way to practice OOP and Python structuring while keeping momentum in coding skills.

------

## Next Steps

- Complete Windows Command Line module and continue advancing through CPTS pathway.
- Maintain regular progress in Python and CCNA studies.
- Refine persistence notes into structured playbooks for quick reference.

------

üî• **End of Week Summary**
 This week balanced structured CPTS progress with hands-on HTB work and creative coding exploration. The Password Attacks module demanded deep focus and yielded valuable playbooks. The Access box reinforced the impact of weak credential management and careful enumeration. Supplementary Windows training is underway to close gaps in PowerShell and command-line skills. On the personal development front, the Python game project provided both reinforcement of technical fundamentals and a refreshing creative outlet.
