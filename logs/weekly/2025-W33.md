# Weekly Summary – August 18th to 24th, 2025

## Overview
This week balanced **Python development**, **HTB Academy progression**, and a significant overhaul of **note-taking workflows**. Early in the week focused on cleaning and migrating notes, followed by structured progress in both HTB Academy modules and *Black Hat Python* exercises. Midweek saw the creation of bash helpers and scratchpad workflows to reduce context-switching and streamline daily capture. By the end of the week, efforts returned to reinforcing Active Directory enumeration through the Forest box and extending Python into proxy development, while closing with a full notes consolidation pass.

## Key Achievements
- **Notes & Workflow**
  - Migrated and cleaned notes, CTF reports, and logs into VS Code.
  - Evaluated note-taking tools (Cherrytree, Obsidian, Joplin) but opted to refine custom workflow with Xed, VS Code, and scripts.
  - Built bash tools (`scratchpad`, `scratch_snap`, `logcmd`, `lg`, `lecho`) to capture commands, outputs, and notes into structured daily directories.
  - Consolidated and reorganized penetration-related notes at week’s end.

- **HTB Academy**
  - **Information Gathering – Web Edition**: Completed (including Creepy Crawlies, Web Archives, and Skill Assessment).
  - **Vulnerability Assessment**: Completed, including Nessus and OpenVAS skill assessments.
  - Practiced **DNS/subdomain/vHost enumeration** with tools like `dig`, `dnsenum`, `gobuster`.
  - Tools explored: `nikto`, `wafw00f`, `reconspider`, `finalrecon`, `nessus`, `openvas`.
  - Returned to the **Forest** box with IppSec’s walkthrough, gaining deeper insights into AD enumeration and exposure to tools like CrackMapExec.

- **Python Development**
  - Advanced through *Black Hat Python – Chapter 2*:
    - Implemented TCP/UDP clients, TCP server.
    - Built a netcat replacement (`netcat.py`) with client/server support.
    - Began building a TCP proxy (`proxy.py`).
  - Key modules practiced: `subprocess`, `argparse`.
  - Encountered and corrected errors in provided code examples (e.g., mismatched handler names).

## Reflections
- Significant progress in **reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning**, adding breadth to tool familiarity and strengthening practical penetration workflows.
- Continued reinforcement of **Python as a red team tool**, with scripts moving from basic networking into functional replacements and proxies.
- Workflow automation efforts paid off, reducing friction and preparing for smoother documentation and logging during live pentests.

## Next Steps
- Expand functionality of `netcat.py` for more robust shell handling.
- Continue development of `proxy.py` for protocol analysis and traffic manipulation.
- Apply new bash logging workflow in upcoming HTB sessions, with regular cleanups to promote useful findings.
- Deepen Windows/AD tooling knowledge (e.g., CrackMapExec) alongside HTB engagements.
