# Weekly Summary – August 25th to 31st, 2025

## Overview
This week emphasized **Python development**, **HTB Academy progression**, and the creation of practical bash tools to streamline workflow. The focus was split evenly between structured learning through *Black Hat Python* and live engagement modules on HTB Academy, particularly around file transfers, shells, and payloads. By the end of the week, both Python projects and HTB modules saw measurable progress, while workflow tools provided better project organization.

## Key Achievements

- **HTB Academy**
  - Completed the **File Transfer** module (Linux & Windows).
  - Completed the **Shells & Payloads** module, including:
    - Difference between bind and reverse shells.
    - Payload generation with `msfvenom`.
    - Deploying payloads with `Metasploit`.
    - Establishing interactive shells and web shells.
    - Identified detection and prevention techniques.
  - Reinforced methodology for choosing and executing payloads in live environments.

- **Python Development**
  - Advanced in *Black Hat Python – Chapter 2*:
    - Built a TCP Proxy (`proxy.py`).
    - Implemented SSH command and reverse command scripts (`ssh_cmd.py`, `ssh_rcmd.py`).
    - Completed SSH server implementation (`ssh_server.py`) using Paramiko.
  - Explored staged vs stageless payloads with external resources.
  - Deepened familiarity with Python’s `socket` module and Paramiko library.

- **Bash & Workflow**
  - Created a **scratchpad manager** script for organizing pentest projects, integrating screenshots directly into project notes for faster referencing.

## Reflections
- Windows pentesting skills were tested and improved during file transfer exercises, with practical exposure to tools like `certutil`, `smbserver`, and `PrintSpoofer`.
- Solidified foundational knowledge around shells and payloads, establishing confidence in crafting and handling interactive access.
- Expanded workflow automation with bash scripting, reducing overhead during engagements and training.
- Gained useful external insights on staged vs stageless payloads, clarifying prior confusion.

## Next Steps
- Continue Python development into more advanced network manipulation and payload handling.
- Begin exploring Netmiko as a recommended alternative to Paramiko if stability issues arise.
- Expand bash tooling further for automation and documentation during HTB and VM engagements.
