## Observations & Lessons Learned  
- I tend to expect challenges to be more complicated than they actually are, which throws me off. Iâ€™ll need to revisit this mindset, particularly with the *Attacking Common Services* module.  
- Always check configuration files of running services for credentials. They may contain sensitive information even when not flagged by automated tools like **linPEAS**.

## Knowledge & Skill Development  

### Hack The Box  

#### Academy â€“ *Attacking Common Services*  
This module emphasized the methodology of attacking non-web services (file storage, email, databases, etc.), including common misconfigurations and known vulnerabilities. Key focus areas:  
- Understanding the concept of attacks  
- Finding sensitive information  
- User enumeration  
- Validating credentials  
- Remote code execution  
- Privilege escalation  

#### HTB â€“ Additional Work  
- Completed auxiliary module tasks  
- Worked through relevant HTB boxes  
- Supplemented learning with IppSec videos for deeper insights  

---

### Python  
- Continued daily hands-on practice; nothing major, but reinforcing fundamentals consistently.  

---

## Next Steps  
- Begin Academy Module: **Pivoting, Tunneling, and Port Forwarding**  
- Refresh **bash scripting** skills with a pentesting focus  
- Complete two random HTB boxes  
- Develop something meaningful in Python alongside practice

ðŸ”¥ **End of Week Summary**  
This week reinforced the importance of keeping things simple and not overthinking challenges. The *Attacking Common Services* module provided valuable exposure to non-web attack surfaces and practical enumeration techniques. Consistent practice with HTB boxes and Python is helping maintain steady progress.
