# Week 02 Summary: June 25 – July 4, 2025

## PWK & OSCP Study
- Completed Modules 6–8, Sections 17–20.2:
  - Manual enumeration, vulnerability scanning, BurpSuite/web attacks
  - Exploit dev (tested on DC:2)
- Strong alignment observed with HTB workflow

## Python Practice
- Finished MOOC parts 2–3
- Began alternating with 100 Days of Code
- Built CLI utilities for flow control, string processing
- Applied Python to red team tooling (e.g., pty.spawn for shell handling)

## Hack The Box
✅ Boxes Completed:
- FTP Breach, S3 Shell, WinRM/NTLMv2 Chain
- Archetype (MSSQL → Impacket → WinPEAS)
- Lame (Samba RCE CVE-2007-2447)
- Bashed (cronjob privesc)
- Unified (Log4Shell → MongoDB)
- Vaccine (ZIP crack → SQLMap → vi/GTFOBins)

## Lab Infrastructure
- Built AD lab: Windows Server, Kali, clients via QEMU
- Rebuilt John, Nmap for GPU optimization
- Refined automation workflows for repeatable use

## Key Takeaways
- Repetition and simulation >> passive learning
- Fluency with system-level tools improving
- Python now operational vs academic
