# Week 03 Summary: July 5 – July 12, 2025

## 🔍 Red Team Progress
✅ HTB Boxes Completed:
- **Shocker** — Shellshock (CVE-2014-6271) via Metasploit → Meterpreter session
- **Optimum** — HFS 2.3 CVE → `bfill.exe` used for privilege escalation
- **Blue** — Weak SMB config, no exploit required
- **Cronos** — SQLi → Burp RCE → Cronjob privesc

### Tools Used:
- Metasploit, msfvenom, linPEAS, Burp Suite, enum4linux, smbclient
- Windows Exploit Suggester, exploit-db, Oracle docs

### Concepts Reinforced:
- Metasploit chaining, payload customization, staged vs stageless logic
- Post-exploitation enumeration and credential capture
- Privilege escalation via scheduled tasks and reverse shell chaining
- Fluent tool use without relying on external lookup

---

## 🐍 Python Practice

- Completed final segments of the MOOC (Part 3–4):
  - Functions, return values, loop control, and list manipulation
  - Explored recursive returns and nested functions (`factorial(factorial(n))`)
- Transitioned to **Automate the Boring Stuff (ATBS)**:
  - Skimmed/read to pg. 82 — focused on useful, operational scripting
  - Reconnected learning to practical automation goals
- Built CLI tools for structured input/output, basic analysis, and loop control

## 📘 OSCP PWK Study

- Reviewed:
  - Ch. 16.3.2 – Windows privilege escalation (manual vs automated techniques)
  - Ch. 20.2 – Payload generation (bad character handling, msfvenom flags)
  - Ch. 15.4 – Exploit chaining based on service banners and known vulns
- Connected exploitation logic directly to lab behavior

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Tools now feel intuitive: using Burp Suite without lookup, structuring payloads on the fly
- linPEAS overwhelming but valuable — requires smart filtering
- Switching from MOOC to ATBS renewed energy and clarity
- Enumeration → logic → privilege escalation path becoming second-nature
