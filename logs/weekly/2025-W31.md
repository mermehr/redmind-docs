# Week Summary: August 4 – August 10, 2025

## Red Team Progress

### HTB Academy – CPTS Pathway

- Advanced through **Module 90** (Penetration Testing Process) and completed **Getting Started** modules. Covered:
  - Penetration test lifecycle from preparation and contracts to exploitation and reporting.
  - Common tools, service scanning, enumeration, privilege escalation fundamentals, and file transfer methods.
  - OSINT techniques including targeting employee repositories for SSH key discovery.
  - Lateral movement steps and proof-of-concept development.
- Began **Enumeration** module (Sections 1–4) with focus on `nmap` scan types, and optimal usage.
- Refreshed on terminal productivity tools (`tmux`, `vim`) and integrated them into workflow for CTF and box work.
- **Nibbles** revisited pre-Academy for reinforcement—completed full exploitation chain with manual Metasploit payload adjustments, privilege escalation via PHP sudo rights, and enumeration practice.

### Practical Work

- Practiced on multiple boxes outside Academy’s guided flow, solidifying skills in:
  - Metasploit exploitation and payload tuning.
  - Privilege escalation on Linux targets.
  - Toolchain usage (`whatweb`, `gobuster`, `nmap`, `python3`, `php`).

## Python Practice – ATBS Progress

### Chapters Covered

- ✅ **Chapter 12** – Command Line Programs (complete)  
  - Environment setups per project to avoid dependency conflicts.  
  - Packaging with PyInstaller, Bext, PyMsgBox.  
  - Multi-OS deployment considerations.
- ✅ **Chapter 13** – Web Scraping (in progress)  
  - Covered `webbrowser`, `requests`, HTML basics, and API access.  
  - Created practical scripts:  
    - `fishtank.py` (CLI aquarium screensaver)  
    - `snowstorm.py` (CLI snow globe)  
    - `showmap.py` (map display via `webbrowser`)  
    - Weather API fetcher
  - Built `daily_journal.py` to auto-generate and open new daily logs from a template.

### Skills Strengthened

- Isolated virtual environment management for Python 2 & 3.
- Identifying and resolving library issues (`playsound` 1.2.2 vs 1.3.0).
- Combining scripting with workflow automation for productivity.

## ⚙Tools & Resources Practiced

- **Red Team**: Metasploit, Nmap, Gobuster, WhatWeb, HackTricks, CVSS scoring tools, tmux, vim.
- **Python**: `webbrowser`, `requests`, PyInstaller, virtualenv, custom scripting utilities.

## Key Takeaways

- HTB Academy provided deeper context on methodology and documentation—reinforcing *why* techniques are used, not just *how*.
- Revisiting prior boxes like Nibbles proved valuable for practicing new workflow improvements (`tmux`/`vim`) and fine-tuning exploitation steps.
- Python scripting is increasingly integrated into daily workflow—both for learning and operational support.
- Balancing guided Academy learning with hands-on, unguided box work continues to strengthen adaptability.
