## Tooling & Workflow  
- Explored the idea of hijacking sudo sessions via /proc, TTYs, and caching — good reminder that curiosity opens up new escalation angles even if not immediately exploitable. Cheatsheet made in notes with the commands I used to explore this idea.  
- Made a cheats sheet for creating custom wordlists with hashcat and cewl

---

## Observations & Lessons Learned  
- Going to need lots of practice with password cracking to build muscle memory for command formats. 
- Attacking windows credential manager section had a bit of a weird quirk that turned out to need privesc to complete the section challenge. Haven't made it into that module of the course yet so it was fun to figure it out. They did hint on a UAC bypass but I managed to pillage the admin creds without any trouble.
- Any intuition moments worth noting (“something looked off and turned out to be a vuln”).
