## Tooling & Workflow  
- Explored escalation concepts by examining `/proc`, TTYs, and sudo caching. Reinforced that curiosity can uncover useful privilege escalation angles, even when not directly exploitable. Documented commands in a new cheatsheet.  
- Built a **custom wordlist cheatsheet** with Hashcat and Cewl for future cracking exercises.  
- Drafted a concept note on **VM Snapshot & Disk Image Attacks**, stored under *Post-Exploitation/Data-Hunting*.  

---

## Observations & Lessons Learned  
- Password cracking requires deliberate practice to develop command-line fluency and muscle memory.  
- Discovered a quirk in the *Windows Credential Manager* exercise: the section required privilege escalation before completion. Although the course hinted at UAC bypass, I managed to obtain administrator credentials directly — a satisfying win outside the prescribed path.  
- Logged an intuition-based catch (spotting something that looked “off” and confirming it as a vulnerability).  
- Documented a key takeaway here: [2025-09-11.md](../field-lesson/2025-09-11.md).

## Knowledge & Skill Development  

### Hack The Box  

#### Academy – *Password Attacks*  
**Sections Completed:**  
- Password Cracking Techniques  
- Remote Password Attacks  
- Extracting Passwords from Windows Systems  
- Extracting Passwords from Linux Systems  
- Extracting Passwords from the Network  

**Notes:**  
> Nearly complete. The *Windows Lateral Movement Techniques* subsection is dense and demanding. Staying committed to completing it without hints or external solutions.  

---

#### HTB – Additional Work  
- Completed 3 miscellaneous challenges — concise exercises that broadened exposure to varied attack vectors.  
- Reviewed [HTB Access – IppSec Walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr6Oxrj2IjU&list=PLidcsTyj9JXItWpbRtTg6aDEj10_F17x5&index=8) for deeper insights.  

---

### Python  

**Scripts Produced:**  
- `ying_yang.py` – A small, self-developed logic puzzle game.  

---

## Next Steps  
- Complete the *Password Attacks* module and transition into an auxiliary module on **Active Directory**.  
- Focused HTB boxes: *Jerry* (re-run), *Access*, and *Weak*.  
- Initiate a new Python project and allocate time for **CCNA lab work** to maintain networking fundamentals.

🔥 **End of Week Summary**  
This week reinforced persistence and hands-on exploration. By refusing shortcuts, I strengthened my problem-solving resilience, especially within the Password Attacks module. Supplementary HTB challenges and scripting kept skills diverse, while observations in Windows Credential Manager highlighted the importance of lateral thinking. Next week, the plan is to pivot into Active Directory and balance red team practice with network fundamentals.
