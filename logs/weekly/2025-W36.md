## Tooling & Workflow  
- Began creating a `grep | awk | sed | sort` cheat sheet. Many of these red team pipeline commands parallel those used in network administration, though with more targeted â€” and at times nefarious â€” applications.  
- Migrated from Bash to Zsh, converting existing helpers and developing new ones to streamline daily workflow.  

---

## Observations & Lessons Learned  
- **Burp Suite**: Leaving blank lines after payload injections in Repeater mode can cause requests to fail silently. Always verify request formatting.  
- **Union**: Served as an excellent practical introduction to SQL injection enumeration and exploitation.  
- **Soccer**: Encountered repeated `502 Bad Gateway` errors while testing HTTP services. Switching VPN endpoints from the US to the EU resolved the issue.  
- **Black Hat Python (2nd Ed.)**: Content is scattered and inconsistent, making it unreliable as a step-by-step guide. More valuable when treated as a supplemental reference.

## Knowledge & Skill Development  

### Hack The Box  

#### Academy - Metasploit Framework (Complete)  
This module provided deeper insights into **msfconsole** than expected, reinforcing the value of revisiting fundamentals. Even seemingly basic modules revealed techniques and nuances previously overlooked.  

**Key Takeaways:**  
- Effective use of search functions  
- Configuration of exploits and payloads  
- Leveraging the MSF database  
- Session management and handling  

**Quote that resonated strongly:**  

> *"You only have to impress yourself, not the infosec community. If we achieve the first, the latter will come naturally. Many artists stray from their original goals in pursuit of validation. Their work becomes stale and generic to the keen eye, but appealing to the everyday user. As security researchers or penetration testers, we only need to validate vulnerabilities â€” not our egos."*

#### HTB â€“ Additional Work  
- Explored supplemental modules in the **Fundamentals** section (Linux, Windows, and Web Applications) to extract additional insights.  
- Completed 7 miscellaneous challenges â€” short, practical exercises that provided exposure to diverse attack vectors.  

---

### Python  

#### Black Hat Python â€“ Chapter 3: Writing a Sniffer (Complete)  
Developed and tested custom scripts for low-level packet inspection and host discovery.  

**Scripts Produced:**  
- `icmp_sniffer.py` â€“ Captures and parses IP/ICMP headers for inbound packets.  
- `udp_icmp_scanner.py` â€“ Conducts UDP sprays and captures ICMP responses for live host discovery.  

---

## Next Steps  
- Begin CPTS Module: **Password Attacks**.  
- Select and develop a Python project outside of red teaming to reinforce fundamentals and broaden practical coding skills.

ðŸ”¥ **End of Week Summary**  
This week consolidated hands-on red team practice with structured learning modules. Completing *Union* and *Soccer* strengthened SQL injection and troubleshooting skills under real-world constraints, while the Metasploit Framework module reinforced core exploitation methodology. Parallel scripting exercises in Python expanded network-level capabilities. Workflow refinements â€” particularly migrating to Zsh and building custom cheat sheets â€” further streamlined efficiency.  

Overall, this week marked a balanced progression of **practical exploitation**, **tooling refinement**, and **fundamental skill-building** â€” setting a strong foundation for upcoming modules on password attacks and more advanced scripting.
