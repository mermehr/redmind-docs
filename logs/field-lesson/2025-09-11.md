# Field Lesson – Honeypot vs. Real Answer

**Date:** 2025-09-11  
**Context:** HTB Academy – Password Attacks (Credential Hunting in Linux)  

---

## Situation
- Encountered multiple potential artifacts:
  - `Notes.zip` (encrypted) → looked juicy but was a honeypot.  
  - `passwd.bak` (readable) + `shadow.bak` (not accessible).  
  - Cron jobs (daily, not practical in short lab window).  
  - `.bash_history` with artifacts that led to Will’s creds (the *real* answer).  

---

## Key Takeaways
- **Don’t overthink the question wording.**  
  - “Will’s password” = any credential tied to Will, not strictly `/etc/shadow`.  
- **Easy clues are often the intended path** in training modules.  
- **Other artifacts can still be logged** as valid real-world angles, even if they’re not the graded answer.  
- **Time matters.** Daily cron = realistic but impractical in a lab.

## Lesson
When multiple angles appear:  
1. Capture and test the **first thing that fits the wording**.  
2. Log all other artifacts for practice and methodology building.  
3. Remember that training ≠ real-world: sometimes the “easy” find is the point.

**Muscle Memory:** Honeypot files (like encrypted ZIPs) are often decoys.  
**Mindset:** Don’t second-guess an obvious win — validate it, then move deeper if needed.
