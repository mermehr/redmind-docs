## Red Team Journal – June 18, 2025

## Target: VulnHub – Basic Pentesting 1 

**Goal:** Identify multiple attack vectors on a previously rooted target to expand red team methodology and avoid chasing dead ends.

---

## Status
-  **Root previously obtained**
-  Focus now on identifying *alternate attack vectors* and sharpening post-exploitation awareness

---

## Observed Attack Surfaces

### 1. **FTP – ProFTPD 1.3.3c**
- Port 21/tcp hosting FTP service
- Attempted anonymous login – **rejected**
- Service version vulnerable to:
  - `mod_copy` file read/write (CVE-2015-3306)`
- Potential to:
  - Extract `/etc/passwd`, `.bash_history`
  - Drop SSH public key to user `.ssh/authorized_keys`

---

### 2. **SSH – OpenSSH 7.2p2 (Ubuntu 16.04)**

 - User identified: `marlinspike`
 - Brute-force
   - `hydra -l marlinspike -P rockyou.txt ssh://192.168.56.103`
  - Guest GUI access also present
   -  Allows filesystem exploration
    - Access to `/home/marlinspike/` potential via GUI
    - Could place backdoor or inject SSH keys

---

### 3. **Guest GUI Access – X Session**

-   Logged in as guest user
-   Actions taken: 
    -   Explored user home directories, /etc, /var
    -   Looked for credential files, browser history        
    -   Considered SSH key injection via `.ssh/authorized_keys`        
-   Good opportunity to simulate physical access exploitation

---

## Conclusion

This VM served as a **sandbox for multi-vector exploration** after already gaining root. Used it to reinforce:

-   FTP exploitation techniques    
-   SSH brute methodology       
-   Physical access techniques via GUI    
-   Systematic thinking when walking away from dead ends
