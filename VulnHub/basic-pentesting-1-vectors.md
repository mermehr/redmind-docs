## 🖥️ Target: VulnHub – Basic Pentesting 1  
**Goal:** Identify multiple attack vectors on a previously rooted target to expand red team methodology and avoid chasing dead ends.

---

## ✅ Status
- 🎯 **Root previously obtained**
- 🧠 Focus now on identifying *alternate attack vectors* and sharpening post-exploitation awareness
