# Training Summary: June 25 – July 4, 2025
🧠 PWK & OSCP Study

    Module 6–8 & Sections 17–20.2 covered:

        Manual enumeration techniques (no-internet, native tools)

        Vulnerability scanning basics (Nessus, Nmap NSE)

        Web attack vectors (BurpSuite, XSS, injection theory)

        Enumeration and privilege escalation strategies

        Exploit development logic (tested on DC:2)

    Strong alignment observed between PWK content and HTB workflows

🐍 Python Practice

    Completed MOOC 2025 Parts 2–3, reinforced:

        Conditions, loops, control structures, and flow logic

        Scripted tools for system housekeeping and coursework support

    Began alternating between 100 Days of Code and MOOC for practical relevance

    Built CLI programs for string processing, user interaction, and simple logic flows

    Reinforced post-exploitation shell stabilization with pty.spawn()

💻 Hack The Box
✅ Boxes Completed:

    FTP Breach, S3 Shell, WinRM/NTLMv2 Chain

    Archetype: MSSQL → Impacket → WinPEAS → Admin shell

    Lame: Samba RCE (CVE-2007-2447) with Metasploit

    Bashed: Web shell → cronjob privesc → root

    Unified: Log4Shell → MongoDB hash injection

    Vaccine: ZIP crack → SQLMap → vi/GTFOBins privesc

🧰 Key Tools:

    nmap, gobuster, wfuzz, Responder, evil-winrm

    nc, python, john, SQLMap, impacket, winpeas

🧪 Lab & Tooling

    Built and customized Active Directory lab using:

        Windows Server (AD, DNS), client VMs, Kali VM

        Bridged networks via QEMU/libvirt

    Deployed custom BurpSuite proxy setup with VPN compatibility

    Rebuilt tools (John, Nmap) for GPU optimization

    Refined local scripts and automation tools for repeatable workflows

🔑 Key Takeaways

    Repetition and real-world emulation (HTB + AD lab) is reinforcing core concepts faster than theory alone

    System-level troubleshooting and setup (firewalls, proxies, VMs) is increasing confidence in off-script problem solving

    Python scripting is becoming more intuitive and directly applicable to both offensive security and productivity
