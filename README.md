# RedMind Docs

A living repository of cybersecurity practice, offensive security labs, system scripts, and field notes. This repo serves as a tactical logbook and personal portfolio — documenting both technical growth and red team execution.

Former infrastructure tech turned offensive security practitioner. Strong grounding in Linux systems, endpoint hardening, scripting, and adversarial methodology.

## What’s Inside

### Logs

Structured summaries of hands-on practice, script development, system configuration, and red team study. Tracks progress across platforms and tool-chains.

See: [`redmind-scripts`](https://github.com/mermehr/redmind-scripts/) for all some scripts mentioned in logs. As they will not be directly linked.

> _Skills shown:_ Self-directed learning, documentation discipline, workflow evolution

---

### Boxes

Reports of Hack The Box, VulnHub, and other lab machines. Includes enumeration, exploit chains, privilege escalation, and cleanup steps.

> _Skills shown:_ Vulnerability exploitation, Linux enumeration, methodology refinement

---

### Notes

Quick-access references for enumeration, reverse shells, SQL injection, privilege escalation, and more — formatted for fast ops recall.

- This area will be in a state of flux, as it will be constantly updated and restructured.

> _Skills shown:_ Curated research, operational speed, technique consolidation

### [Scripts & Tooling Repo](https://github.com/mermehr/remind-scripts)

- Python and Bash tools for automation, parsing, and red team support.

- Includes Network, Reconnaissance, System and Note-taking scripts.

- Mainly are custom scripts, some networking scripts are modified from ***Black Hat Python***.
  
  > _Skills shown:_ CLI development, subprocess control, system interfacing, offensive tool integration
