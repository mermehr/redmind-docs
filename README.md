# RedMind Docs

A living repository of cybersecurity practice, offensive security labs, system scripts, and field notes. This repo serves as a tactical logbook and personal portfolio — documenting both technical growth and red team execution.

Former infrastructure tech turned offensive security practitioner. Strong grounding in Linux systems, endpoint hardening, scripting, and adversarial methodology.

## What’s Inside

### Logs

Structured summaries of hands-on practice, script development, system configuration, and red team study. Tracks progress across platforms and toolchains.

See: [`custom-python-scripts`](https://github.com/mermehr/custom-python-scripts/) for all scripts mentioned in logs. As they will not be directly linked.
