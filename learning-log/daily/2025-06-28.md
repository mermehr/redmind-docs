### OSCP Bible

**Chapter 8 – Web Attacks & BurpSuite**

* Focused on BurpSuite usage for intercepting and modifying HTTP traffic
* Covered theoretical XSS and Java-based injection attacks
* Light Gobuster enumeration
* Takeaway: Reinforced the role of interception proxies in web testing and how Java-based payloads behave

---

### Lab Environment

**Pivoted Away from Prebuilt Microsoft Lab**

* Successfully deployed `Win11_24H2_Lab_3.4`, but limitations in evaluation licensing, VM sprawl, and network config friction prompted a pivot
* Decided to **build a custom AD lab manually on a Linux host** for:
  - Full control over snapshots, services, and network routing
  - Better understanding of how AD components actually come together
  - Avoiding locked-down provisioning scripts and dependency on Hyper-V

**New Goal:**
* Set up fresh Windows Server VM and install:
  - AD DS
  - DNS
  - DHCP (optional)
* Add at least one Windows 10/11 client (evaluation)
* Connect a Kali VM for enumeration and offensive testing
* Configure an isolated virtual LAN using `libvirt`, `virt-manager`, or VirtualBox bridged/internal networks

### Hack The Box

**Box aligned with OSCP Chapter 8**

* Followed BurpSuite workflow closely from the chapter
* XSS payload testing and HTTP proxy interception
* Encountered technical hurdle: BurpSuite proxy struggled with bridged VM and VPN combo (intermittent drops)
* Chose to stick with custom Kali setup instead of HTB Pwnbox for deeper troubleshooting practice

### Python MOOC 2025

**Progress: Part 3 – Loops with Conditions**

* Completed the majority of loop exercises with `while` / `for` + conditionals
* Concepts solidified:
  - Loop nesting
  - Flow control inside loops
  - Boolean logic with loop conditions

---

### Key Takeaways

* BurpSuite networking limitations taught more than the web vulnerabilities themselves
* HTB box reinforced proxy use under challenging real-world conditions
* Major milestone: AD Lab now live, paving way for real Windows lateral movement and post-exploitation work
* Python logic skills growing steadily; foundation feeling more natural daily
