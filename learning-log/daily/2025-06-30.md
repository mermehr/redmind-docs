## Daily Journal – June 28, 2025 – Hybrid Entry

Today was a deep-dive chaos day. Nothing neatly boxed. No tight workflows. Just constant motion between red team ops, system hardening, and toolchain tweaks — but every hour fed the next.

---

## Boxes Completed
- **Unified**: Exploited Log4J (CVE-2021-44228), used rogue-JNDI + BurpSuite proxy to trigger a remote shell, modified MongoDB hashes to gain admin access, pulled root SSH credentials from the admin panel.
- **Vaccine**: FTP enumeration led to ZIP cracking (John the Ripper), admin creds pulled and cracked (MD5 → qwerty789), used SQLmap to gain foothold, escalated to root via vi/GTFOBins trick under sudo.

---

## System Work
- Deep into **firewall management** today — UFW filtering by interface, testing bridging/routing setups.
- Rebuilt and deployed GPU-enhanced versions of:
  - **John the Ripper** (for faster brute force / hash cracking)
  - **Nmap** (optimized for wide scans with heavy script use)
- Resolved **BurpSuite** proxy issues. Finally working cleanly through VPN with FoxyProxy + upstream proxy tweaks.
- Also set up **QEMU** with bridged networking and fixed a broken `virtlibd` service that was blocking VM provisioning. Took a bit of digging, but everything’s running clean now.

## Reflections
- Most of what I did today lived in terminal history, log files, or scattered readmes — but it added up.
- Didn’t have a clean note-taking mindset, but that’s okay. Mental downloads like today make future structured learning sharper.
- Pushed through frustration and kept learning in the middle of it. That matters more than a tidy entry.

## Tomorrow
- Might look into Active Directory attacks or some web-heavy HTB box.
- Could also spend a half-day organizing some of this config/setup work into scripts or notes.
