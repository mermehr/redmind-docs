## Notes

Went back today and did a rerun of the labs from this week's footprinting module. While I didnâ€™t use the guided mode or follow someone else's write-up the first time, I did go and steal tidbits here and there to help me through the labs. Just wanted to challenge myself and what I learned in this module to see if I could do it solo without notes.
