## Today's Progress

### HTB  

**Penetration Tester Sections:**

- Module 77 – Getting Started
  - Did the first couple of modules

### Python

**ATBS or Ops:**  

- Chapter: 12 – Command Line Programs  

**Chapter 12 Complete - Summary:**

- PyInstaller, Bext, PyMsgBox - Modules
- Virtual environments
- Building and deploying on Windows/MacOS/Linux

### Challenges Faced

Nothing much today, mainly just ingesting material from HTB and no real scripting involved with this past section of ATBS.

### Commands Practiced

- `command here`
- `command here`

### Concepts Reinforced

### Tools / Resource(s) Used

- [HTB - Basic Cheat Sheet](assets/Getting_Started_Module_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)

### Notes

Not a lot of time to day. I'll have to spend a bit trying to figure out a decent program to consolidate programming/logging. Markdown is obviously the better choice all around so I won't be straying away from that, guess I'll have to give vs code another go.
