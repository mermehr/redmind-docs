### Today's Progress

**HTB**  
**Target Box:**
- 

**Challenges**  
- 

**CPTS Sections:**  
- 

**Python (ATBS or Ops):**  
- Chapter: 12 – Command Line Programs  
- Pages: 257–267 – Environment setup

### Challenges Faced
- Getting Obsidian setup in a way I can use it efficiently 

### Commands Practiced
- `pip` - a bit more on installing/uninstalling and modifying packages
- `command here`

### Concepts Reinforced
While I have python 3 and 2 setup in user environments it was good practice to setup environments for each program when needed as no not break others.

### Tools / Resource(s) Used
- [Tool or doc link]
- [YouTube, GitHub, etc.]

### Notes
ATBS resource package in pip was broken for python 3.12, specifically `playsound==1.3.0`. `playsound==1.2.2` works just fine with python 3.12, turns out when the project was abandoned they broke their `setup.py` for anything passed python 3.10.
