**Focus Areas**: Python, HTB Academy

---

## HTB

**Target Box:** ***Return to Nibbles*** + ***Other***

Nibbles was completed pre Academy:

- [Nibbles Report](../../ctfs/HTB/nibbles-report.md)
- Other:
  - Metasploit to shell using CVE
  - Used sudo priv on /usr/bin/php to spawn reverse shell and grab flags

**Penetration Tester Section:**

- Module: Getting Started - Complete
  
  - An overview of penetration testing
  - Penetration testing distros and note-taking
  - An overview of common terms and technologies
  - An introduction to scanning and enumeration
  - Using public exploits and shells
  - Basics of file transfers
  - Privilege escalation primer
  - Navigating the HTB platform, getting help, asking questions, and common pitfalls
  - Completed our first two boxes (one guided and one without a guide)

## Python

**ATBS or Ops:**

- Chapter: 13 - Web Scrapping
- Pages: 297â€“301
  - Accessing a Weather APIs

## Concepts Reinforced

While I had previously completed the Nibbles box, I still went through it again for practice and to see if I had missed anything. It also gave me a chance for further practice with tmux, vim and pentest tools.

## Tools / Resource(s) Used

- `vimtutor`
- `tmux` - [Quick guide by Ham Vocke](https://hamvocke.com/blog/a-quick-and-easy-guide-to-tmux/)
- `whatweb`, `gobuster`, `nmap`, `python3`, `php`, `metasploit`

## Notes

Having used nano forever, I realized for penetration testing I would need to convert over to vim/vi. I know enough about vi for general usage, but going through vimtutor was beneficial for learning a bit more. Same with tmux, this terminal manager will save me from a lot of frustration. Mostly I've only ever needed to use one or two terminals.
