## Notes

DNS enumeration gave me some trouble. I'll have to make a note of that and do some more digging. IMAP crib commands also sent me for a bit of a loop, but I got the hang of it.

Python integration with SQLite was a good read, I highly doubt I'll use most of it in the real world. Though, I will probably use the information to retrieve data from databases in general. I can't see myself needed to write or create databases, but if that time ever comes I'll have a good introduction to go off of.
