### Completed Tasks

Red Team Target — Escalate My Privileges: 1
* Box completed and report finalized
* Incorporated enumeration steps and shell stabilization techniques into workflow
* Validated importance of TTY management and `socat`-based upgrades

Python – Chapter 9: Regex
* Created:
  - A basic recon `.sh` wrapper
  - A Python parser to clean and extract useful results from Nmap/Gobuster
* Made recon output far more readable and actionable
* Plan to continue with more Python reading tomorrow

Cisco Ethical Hacker – Module 3: Information Gathering and Vulnerability Scanning
* Completed entire module including:
  - OSINT, active vs. passive recon, footprinting techniques
  - Vulnerability scanning methodologies, tools, and scan types
  - Considerations for compliance, stealth, and prioritization
* Reflected on importance of identifying vulnerabilities early in the kill chain

Reflection Prompts:
- **Attack vector wasn’t hidden** — the box gave it away immediately
- **Method felt too easy** — this was a beginner box by design, but useful
- **Regex parser improved recon flow** — simplified scan outputs and focused attention

### Additional Notes

- Enumeration logic reaffirmed: each VM = new opportunity depending on exposed services
- Noted that Linux and Windows run services differently (e.g., `svchost.exe` vs. user-owned daemons)
- Ran `enum4linux` and `nikto` despite no indicators — good habit forming
- Built tools that will carry forward: shell stabilization, regex parsing, scan wrappers
