## Python Practice
- Continued foundational Python exercises with a focus on input handling, loop control, and basic conditional logic.
- Built an interactive CLI-based program that used `while` loops, `break` conditions, and formatted output.
- Practiced using `random.choice`, list indexing, and multi-line strings.
- Reinforced use of `pty.spawn()` for shell stabilization, preparing for real-world usage in post-exploitation tasks.

## HTB Progress
- Completed **HTB: Bashed**
  - Discovered exposed web shell via `/dev/phpbash.php`
  - Used Python reverse shell payload to gain a stable shell as `www-data`
  - Escalated to `scriptmanager` via sudo permissions
  - Identified a root cron job executing a writable Python script — used this for privilege escalation
  - Captured both `user.txt` and `root.txt`

## PWK Study
- Read and analyzed **Section 20.2**: Exploit development and application on DC:2; although the exploit didn't succeed, the process was followed through and understood.
- Reviewed **Sections 17.1 and 17.2** covering enumeration strategies and privilege escalation concepts.
