### Completed Tasks

CEH Videos
* Reviewed Module 12 – Pulled useful notes on IDS evasion (insertion/obfuscation) and honeypot logic
* Module 14 skimmed briefly – found minimal value
* Overall takeaway: For me, CEH video content is redundant; similar to Security+ and CCNA, and not worth full time investment going forward
* Decision: Remove CEH curriculum from daily plan, replace with focused YouTube/PDF/video research

Python – Automate the Boring Stuff, Chapter 9
* Completed reading: Pages 186–195
* Learned `re.compile()`, `re.search()`, `re.findall()`
* Practiced patterns for phone numbers, IPs, emails
* Bonus script written to extract IPs/emails from files
* Gained major insight: regex shrinks problem complexity drastically and empowers parsing

Cisco Ethical Hacker – Module 3.2
* Completed full module on scanning types and stealth/active techniques
* Observed overlap with previous network security training
* Took note of tooling details and stealth logic
* VM environment issues resolved manually (Cisco’s Kali image repo was misconfigured)
