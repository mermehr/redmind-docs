## Python MOOC Progress  
- Completed **Part 4 ‚Äì Return Values, Lists, and For Loops**.  
  - Practiced using `return` to pass values from functions and chain return values.  
  - Reinforced type hints (`: int`, `-> float`) and their use in function declarations.  
  - Built a `factorial()` function and explored nested returns: `factorial(factorial(3))`.  
  - Parsed strings with `.find()` and slicing logic to extract first words from input.  
  - Worked through multiple list operations: `append()`, `insert()`, `remove()`, `sort()`, `len()`, and index manipulation.  
  - Iterated over lists with `for` and `while`, and modified values in-place using indexing.

## OSCP PWK Study  
**Section Reviewed:**  
- **Chapter 15.4 ‚Äì Exploiting a Target**  
  - Reviewed how to connect enumeration results to practical exploitation workflows.  
  - Emphasis on chaining previously gathered info (e.g., usernames, share access, banners) into action.  
  - Reiterated `searchsploit` and exploit-db enumeration loops.  
  - Served more as philosophical reinforcement of ‚Äúenumerate ‚Üí pivot ‚Üí exploit‚Äù than deep technical content.

## Red Team Activity ‚Äì HTB: Blue  
- Completed HTB machine **Blue** (Windows ‚Äì Easy).  
- Identified SMB service on ports 139/445 during initial `nmap` scan.  
- Used `enum4linux` and `smbclient` to enumerate shares anonymously.  
- Located `share$` with accessible `user.txt` and `root.txt` ‚Äì no exploitation required.  
- No code execution or LPE path needed ‚Äî box hinged entirely on weak SMB configuration.  

**Tools Used:**  
- `nmap`, `enum4linux`, `smbclient`
