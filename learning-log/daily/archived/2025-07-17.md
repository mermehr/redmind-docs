## PWK Progress  
**Chapter 7 ‚Äì Vulnerability Scanning**  
- Reviewed the differences between **unauthenticated** vs. **authenticated** scans and why authenticated scanning can provide deeper insights into system configurations.
- Studied common tools and techniques used for vulnerability scanning, including **Nessus**, **OpenVAS**, and **Nikto**.
- Understood the concept of **false positives** and how tuning scan configurations helps reduce noise and improves triage.
- Took note of **port scanning vs. vulnerability scanning**, reinforcing that vulnerability scanners often rely on service detection and banner grabbing as foundational techniques.
- Acknowledged the risks of **intrusive scanning**, especially in live environments, and the importance of staging/testing.

## Python ‚Äì ATBS Progress  
**Completed Chapter 6: Functions**  
- Practiced defining functions with parameters and return values.
- Revisited scope handling, function reuse, and argument unpacking.

### End-of-Chapter Practice  
#### üß™ Coin Flip Streak Simulation  
**Script:** `practice-coin-flip-streak.py`  
- Simulates 10,000 coin toss experiments to calculate how often a streak of 6 identical results appears.
- Reinforces randomness, loop logic, streak tracking, and list processing.

#### üìã Comma Code Formatter  
**Script:** `practice-comma-code.py`  
- Custom function to print list items in natural language format (e.g., ‚Äúapples, bananas, and tofu‚Äù).
- Demonstrates a solid grasp of string manipulation, edge-case handling (empty/single item), and join operations.

## Reflection  
A well-rounded day focused on both theoretical and practical elements. Chapter 7 deepened awareness of scanning strategy risks and precision, while Python practice strengthened fundamental logic control. The coin flip simulation in particular offers a great foundation for future probabilistic modeling or malware behavior simulation.
