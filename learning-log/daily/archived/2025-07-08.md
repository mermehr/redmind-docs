# Daily Log – 2025-07-08

## Python MOOC Progress
- Watched the lecture for **Part 3** and completed **Section 3 (Nested Loops)**.
- Practiced using nested `for` loops to build structured output, such as number grids and pattern generation.
- Strengthened understanding of loop control flow and how inner loop execution relates to the outer loop cycle.
- Gained early exposure to combining conditions and counters for layered logic — foundational for more complex control structures in Part 4.

## Red Team Activity – HTB: Shocker
- Completed the **Shocker** box on Hack The Box.
- Used **msfconsole** to exploit a known vulnerability (CVE-2014-6271, Shellshock) on a CGI-enabled Apache web server.
- Launched a **Meterpreter session**, navigated the compromised system, and gathered basic system information.
- Reflected on post-exploitation enumeration and noted interest in scripting enumeration output parsing for efficiency.

## Key Takeaways
- Nested loops are now mentally mapped and can be confidently applied to multi-dimensional problems.
- Reinforced foundational red team tooling with structured Metasploit workflows.
- Workflow clarity is increasing — more fluent between enumeration, exploitation, and post-exploitation.
