## Focus Areas
- Python (ATBS Chapter 6)
- OSCP PWK: Active Directory (Ch. 21–22)

---

## Red Team Progress – OSCP PWK

### **Chapter 21 – Active Directory Introduction and Enumeration**
- Reviewed the architecture and role of **Active Directory** in enterprise networks.
- Practiced **manual enumeration** techniques to identify users, groups, computers, and trust relationships using PowerShell.
- Wrote a **custom PowerShell script** that wrapped key enumeration commands into a reusable function — likely explored `Get-ADUser`, `Get-ADGroupMember`, and `net user /domain`.
- Tested **SharpHound**, exporting collected data and visualizing it in **BloodHound** to identify potential attack paths and high-value targets (e.g., Kerberoastable users, unconstrained delegation, admin paths).

### **Chapter 22 – Attacking Active Directory Authentication**
- Refreshed understanding of **NTLM** and **Kerberos** authentication flows, with attention to:
  - Pass-the-Hash (PTH)
  - Pass-the-Ticket (PTT)
  - TGT / TGS mechanics
- Practiced using **Mimikatz** for credential extraction and ticket manipulation.
- Used **Rubeus** and **kerbrute** to conduct enumeration and password spray attacks.
- Executed **AS-REP Roasting** to extract crackable hashes from accounts without pre-authentication — reviewed implications for weak password policy.
- Strengthened conceptual understanding of how authentication flaws can be leveraged during lateral movement.

## Python Practice – ATBS Chapter 6

### Chapter 6: Lists, Tuples, and Advanced Sequences
- Reviewed **list operations**, including:
  - Indexing, slicing, appending, inserting, and deleting elements.
  - Practical uses of `random.choice()` and `random.shuffle()`.
- Gained exposure to **enumerate()** for generating index-value pairs in for-loops — a key Pythonic pattern.
- Started on **tuples** and **tuple unpacking**, including:
  - Using multiple assignment with unpacking syntax.
  - Recognizing tuple immutability and when to prefer tuples over lists.
- Reinforced through hands-on code inside PyCharm, likely used print-debugging and interactive experimentation.
- Foundation laid for applying lists/tuples in automation and red team tooling.

---

## Concepts Reinforced
- Manual vs. automated enumeration of AD environments.
- PowerShell scripting for AD recon — practical knowledge of how to wrap reconnaissance commands into modular tools.
- Authentication attack techniques: how Kerberos and NTLM flaws can be exploited.
- Python tuple unpacking and use of `enumerate()` in loops.

---

## Challenges Faced
- Overwhelmed by the **information density** in AD chapters (21 & 22) — concepts stacked rapidly, requiring multiple mental models to follow attacks.
- Juggling deep enumeration, scripting, and theory in one sitting pushed cognitive limits.

---

## Wins
- Wrote your **own PowerShell AD enumeration function** — real hands-on win.
- Built comfort with **BloodHound** and how to leverage graph analysis to spot privilege paths.
- Clarified understanding of **AS-REP Roasting** and Kerberos TGT flow — often misunderstood in early red team learning.
- Integrated Python study into the same session without burning out.

---

## Tools & Resources
- **BloodHound** & **SharpHound**
- **Mimikatz**, **kerbrute**, **Rubeus**
- **PowerShell**
- **PyCharm IDE**
- **ATBS – Automate the Boring Stuff with Python**
- [PowerSploit AD Recon Docs](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/)

---

## Tomorrow’s Objectives
- Begin HTB: **Forest** – a real-world AD lab to apply enumeration and attack techniques from PWK.
- Finish ATBS Chapter 6.
  - Stretch goal: Write a small Python script using **exception handling** and **list/tuple structures** to perform a practical task (e.g., a simple file parser or automation helper).
