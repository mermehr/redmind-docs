## Daily Journal – June 24, 2025

### Completed Tasks

**Organization & Workflow**
- Finalized red team syllabus structure for clarity and focus  
- Migrated journaling system to a more comfortable and sustainable platform for long-term writing

**Security Analysis**
- Practiced document scanning techniques to identify malicious content, Java-based injection points, and suspicious function calls

**Study & Reading**
- Reached page 131 in the OSCP manual  
  - So far, not much new knowledge, but the extra detail is appreciated  
  - Glad I skipped the first 5 chapters to avoid redundancy  
  - Will revisit the documentation module at a later point

**Python Practice**
- Focused on mathematical operations and logic workflows for reinforcement (not logging specific content)

**Networking & Lab Setup**
- Resolved VPN and networking conflicts on HTB lab VM  
- Secured a proper sandbox configuration—isolated HTB activity from host while maintaining full internet access

**HTB Progress**
- Completed a couple of small boxes  
- One box required working with a MySQL server—refreshing, as I hadn’t handled that before in a red team context
