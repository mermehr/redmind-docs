### OSCP Bible

**Module 7 Complete**  
Covered vulnerability scanning topics with a focus on **Nessus**. While I don’t have the lab access needed to run full scans, the general workflow is straightforward enough to revisit when necessary. Not something I expect to use unless it's already part of a corporate toolkit.

Also reviewed **Nmap NSE scripts** — important for manual recon and vulnerability enumeration without relying on full automated scanners.

**Tools:**
- `nessus`
- `nmap` (NSE scripting)

### Python

**Focus Area:**
- Practical Python scripting
- 2 automation scripts for housekeeping and system file operations
- Clean-up automation  
- MOOC 2025 course support tooling  

Pulled and organized solution scripts for each part of the *Python Programming MOOC 2025* course.

These changes create a clearer reference base for future learners and allow me to rapidly prototype any tooling I want to spin off from coursework.

### Hack The Box

**Box Completed:** *Archetype*

**Key Elements:**
- Protocols: SMB, MSSQL
- Recon → RCE → Lateral Movement → Privesc
- Tools: `nmap`, `smbclient`, `impacket`, `winpeas`, `nc64`

**Flow:**
Started with anonymous SMB access, found a share containing MSSQL credentials. Used Impacket to authenticate and execute commands over MSSQL, dropped a PowerShell reverse shell via `nc64`. Got user flag, ran WinPEAS to uncover admin credentials in cleartext. Used `psexec` to gain admin access and retrieve root flag.

**What I Could’ve Explored Further:**
- Enumerated more SMB share metadata before jumping in
- Tried alternate methods for executing commands via MSSQL (e.g., xp_cmdshell fallback or PowerUpSQL if blind)
- Compared PEAS results manually to learn more from the privesc path
