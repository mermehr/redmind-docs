## PWK Progress  

**Chapter 7 â€“ Vulnerability Scanning**  
- Completed theory and hands-on work with vulnerability scanners including Nessus and Nmap's NSE.
- Clarified the difference between **unauthenticated vs. authenticated scans**, and saw how credentials offer deeper insight into host configurations.
- Took note of **plugin usage**, **false positives**, and **scan types**.
- Observed the difference in verbosity and stealth across **Nessus scans**, emphasizing the importance of tuning and context-aware tool usage.

**Chapter 8 â€“ Introduction to Web Application Attacks**  
- Completed a deep overview of web app testing methodology, tools, and typical enumeration paths.
- Explored **Wappalyzer**, **Gobuster**, **Burp Suite**, and **manual techniques** for content discovery and header inspection.
- Learned about **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** theory (stored vs. reflected) and practical applications including basic payload insertion and escalation.
- Reinforced the value of **debugging with browser dev tools** and inspecting HTTP responses to gather attack surface data.

## Python â€“ ATBS Progress  
**Completed Chapter 6: Functions**  
- Practiced parameter passing, return statements, scope isolation, and list processing.

### End-of-Chapter Practice  

#### ðŸ§ª Coin Flip Streak Simulation  
**File:** `practice-coin-flip-streak.py`  
- Simulated 10,000 sets of 100 coin flips.
- Detected how often a **6-in-a-row streak** appeared, demonstrating probability application and random list generation.
- Strengthened understanding of loop counters, list indexing, and conditional logic.

#### ðŸ“‹ Comma Code Formatter  
**File:** `practice-comma-code.py`  
- Created a natural language printer for lists.
- Applied logic branching for **empty lists**, **single items**, and joined output using `.join()` and string concatenation.


## Python â€“ ATBS Chapter 7 Progress

- Finished reading up to the Summary and Practice Questions section in **Chapter 7: Dictionaries and Structuring Data**.
- Learned key topics including:
  - Using dictionaries to store key-value mappings (e.g. chessboard positions like `'e2': 'wP'`).
  - Manipulating dictionary contents via `del`, assignment, `.get()`, and iteration over `.keys()`.
  - Simulating more complex structured data with nested structures.

- Applied these skills to a **chessboard CLI project**, implementing:
  - Interactive dictionary-driven board state,
  - Input command parsing for `move`, `remove`, `set`, etc.,
  - Board reset/clear logic using `copy.copy()` for a template,
  - Dynamically generated text-based board visuals from data structure state.

## Reflection  
The last two PWK sections covered key components of network triage and perimeter attack preparation. The theory from vulnerability scanning has already clarified some earlier questions from VM enumeration, and the web application methodology is directly portable to real-world engagements. Python progress complements this with simulation logic and string output formatting â€“ two recurring patterns in red team tooling.
