# Red Team Learning Log

This folder contains my red team learning progression, structured weekly and daily for accountability, review, and knowledge reinforcement.

## Structure

- `summary-pre-log.md`  
  Overview of foundational skills, certifications, and the pivot to red teaming prior to June 13, 2025.

- daily/`  
  Daily breakdowns of learning activity â€” Python progress, HTB engagements, study notes, tooling insights.
  
- `weekly/`  + `monthly/`
  Summarised, high-level overviews of weekly/monthly progress. Useful for quick review, interviews, or journaling retrospectives.

## Purpose

This learning log serves as a timeline of technical development â€” documenting:
- Hands-on red team practice
- Python scripting for offence
- Enumeration and exploitation workflows
- Study milestones (OSCP, ATBS, HTB, etc.)

All logs feed into the broader red team documentation repo:
