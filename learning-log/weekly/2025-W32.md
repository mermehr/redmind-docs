# Week Summary: August 11 ‚Äì August 16, 2025

## üß† Red Team Progress

### HTB Academy ‚Äì CPTS Pathway  

- Completed the **Network Enumeration with Nmap** module:  
  - Covered host discovery, port scanning, service detection, OS fingerprinting, and evasion techniques.  
  - Reinforced skills with practical challenges (Easy, Medium, Hard). Key win: discovered a filtered TCP service on port 50000 and obtained a flag via `nc`.  
- Progressed through and **completed the Footprinting module**:  
  - Enumerated a wide range of core services (FTP, SMB, NFS, DNS, SMTP, IMAP/POP3, SNMP, MySQL, MSSQL, IPMI).  
  - Practiced infrastructure and host-based enumeration, emphasizing manual footprinting and interaction over automated tools.  
  - Labs and challenges simulated realistic target environments, demanding patience and creativity.  
  - Re-ran all labs unguided for deeper reinforcement, producing independent reports for **Easy, Medium, and Hard** scenarios.  

**Lab Highlights:**

- **Easy Lab** ‚Äì Discovered exposed FTP with alternate port, harvested SSH keys, gained access, and retrieved flag.  
- **Medium Lab** ‚Äì Mounted NFS shares, extracted leaked credentials, pivoted into RDP access, uncovered MSSQL admin creds, and enumerated user databases.  
- **Hard Lab** ‚Äì Combined SNMP enumeration, IMAP access, and private key extraction to escalate into SSH. Final step: retrieved target ‚ÄúHTB‚Äù credentials from MySQL.  

**Key Takeaway:** The **Medium lab proved more challenging than the Hard lab**, underscoring the importance of Windows-side enumeration and credential handling.

## üêç Python Practice  

- **Automate the Boring Stuff (ATBS):**  
  - Finished **Chapter 13 (Web Scraping)** and **Chapter 16 (SQL Databases)**.  
  - Gained exposure to `selenium`, `playwright`, and SQLite integrations. While unlikely to use heavy browser automation or database creation in practice, these broadened perspective on web/data interactions.  
  - Concluded ATBS journey on August 15, reflecting on its value as a beginner-to-intermediate foundation.  

- **Transitioned to Black Hat Python:**  
  - Started **Chapter 2 ‚Äì Basic Networking Tools**.  
  - Set up development environment, revisited TCP/UDP connection scripting, and laid groundwork for offensive-security focused Python practice.

## üß† Key Takeaways  

- Marked transition from **guided learning (ATBS)** to **offensive security application (Black Hat Python + HTB Academy labs)**.  
- Enumeration and footprinting skills significantly improved through multi-service practice and lab reports.  
- Confidence boosted in both Linux and Windows-based enumeration; Windows services remain a growth area.  
- Weekly workflow balanced **Python for tooling** and **Academy modules for methodology**, reinforcing adaptability and practical mindset.
