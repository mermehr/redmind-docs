# Week Summary: July 28 – August 3, 2025

## 🧠 Red Team Progress

### HTB Boxes Completed
- ✅ **TwoMillion** – Gained initial access via API enumeration and JavaScript logic flaws. Privilege escalation completed. Strong practical on API abuse and object traversal. [Report](https://github.com/mermehr/redmind-docs/blob/main/engagements/HTB/TwoMillin-report.md)  
- ✅ **Jerry** – Classic Apache Tomcat RCE via Metasploit. Simple box but valuable for practicing enumeration and tooling. [Report](https://github.com/mermehr/redmind-docs/blob/main/engagements/HTB/Jerry-report.md)  
- ✅ **Blue (Revisited)** – Returned to root a 2019 box after a failed Metasploit attempt. Diagnosed reverse shell setup errors and executed EternalBlue exploit successfully.  
- ✅ **Legacy** – Another EternalBlue-targeted box. Solidified SMB recon + Metasploit usage. [Report](https://github.com/mermehr/redmind-docs/blob/main/engagements/HTB/Legacy-report.md)

### HTB Challenges Completed
- `Campfire-2`, `JinjaCare`, `NeoVault` (Web/Sherlock)  
- `Unit42`, `Campfire-1` (Sherlock)  
- `Simple Encryptor`, `Pdfy`, `BabyEncryption` (Rev/Crypto/Web)  
- `Criticalops` (Web)

### HTB Academy Transition
- Started CPTS pathway  
- Identified gap between completing boxes and understanding **why/how** techniques work  
- Reflected need for more concept challenges and deep-dive study beyond walkthroughs

### PWK Progress
- **Chapter 14** – Directory Traversal & File Upload Vulns  
- **Chapter 15.4** – EternalBlue  
- **Chapter 19.2/19.3** – Linux + Windows Privilege Escalation  
- **Chapter 20.1** – Metasploit Modules  
- Final decision: no longer following PWK linearly; shifting to skill-focused progression

## 🐍 Python Practice – ATBS Progress

### Chapters Covered
- ✅ Chapter 10 – Reading and Writing Files  
- ✅ Chapter 11 – Organizing Files

### Scripts Created
- ✅ `quiz-generator.py` – Dynamic quiz + answer key generator  
- ✅ `mad-libs.py` – Template-based story generator  
- ✅ `regex-search.py` – Directory-based search script for regex patterns  
- ✅ `backup-to-zip.py`, `find_large_files.py`, `rename_dates.py`, `renumber_files.py`, `selective_copy.py` – Practical file system automation tools  

### Skills Strengthened
- File IO (read/write, path handling)  
- Regex use in file parsing  
- Directory walking and batch operations  
- Scripting habits for automation-heavy tasks

---

## ⚙️ Tools Practiced
- **Red Team**: Metasploit, Nmap, OS path & file handling, SMB enumeration, API recon  
- **Python**: `os`, `re`, `shutil`, `pathlib` — for scanning, parsing, and automating

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- **Returning to old boxes** provided high-yield learning on exploit mechanics and debugging failed attempts.
- Python scripting is hitting stride—scripts are practical and reusable for red team tooling.
- Shift away from PWK manual marks a turning point toward targeted knowledge-building over linear progression.
- Momentum continues on both fronts—technical depth is growing, and reflection is guiding sharper learning.
