# Simple Mail Transfer Protocol

## Common Attack Paths

### Enumeration
- [ ] Banner grab → `nc <target> 25`
- [ ] VRFY/EXPN → `smtp-user-enum -U users.txt -t <target>`
- [ ] Test relay → `swaks --server <target>`

### Attack Paths
- Open relay → send spoofed mail
- User enumeration → valid usernames for brute force
- Weak creds → brute force or spray
- Exploits in mail server software (Exim, Postfix)

### Auxiliary Notes
- Good source of usernames in corp environments.
- Relay tests can be noisy; proceed carefully.



## General Enumeration

*Common Commands*

`sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -sC -sV -p25`

Open relay check:

`sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -p25 --script smtp-open-relay -v`

### Interacting with the service

`telnet 10.129.14.128 25`

*Commands*

| Command | Description |
| --- |  --- |
| AUTH PLAIN | AUTH is a service extension used to authenticate the client. |
| HELO | The client logs in with its computer name and thus starts the session. |
| MAIL FROM | The client names the email sender. |
| RCPT TO | The client names the email recipient. |
| DATA | The client initiates the transmission of the email. |
| RSET | The client aborts the initiated transmission but keeps the connection between client and server. |
| VRFY | The client checks if a mailbox is available for message transfer. |
| EXPN | The client also checks if a mailbox is available for messaging with this command. |
| NOOP | The client requests a response from the server to prevent disconnection due to time-out. |
| QUIT | The client terminates the session. |
