- `>` / `<` → indent / unindent selection  

---

## Search & Replace
- `/pattern` → search forward  
- `?pattern` → search backward  
- `n` → repeat search  
- `N` → repeat search in opposite direction  
- `:%s/foo/bar/g` → replace all *foo* with *bar*  
- `:%s/foo/bar/gc` → replace with confirm  

---

## Buffers & Windows
- `:e file` → open another file

- `:bd` → delete buffer  
- `:sp file` → split window horizontally

---

## Marks & Jumps
- `ma` → set mark *a* at cursor  
- `` `a `` → jump to mark *a*  
- `` '' `` → jump back to last position  

---

## Configuration
- `:set number` → show line numbers  
- `:set relativenumber` → relative line numbers  
- `:syntax on` → enable syntax highlighting  
- `:set tabstop=4` → set tab width  
- `:set expandtab` → use spaces instead of tabs  
- `:set autoindent` → enable auto-indentation

## Practical Notes
- **hjkl** = movement keys in normal mode.  
- Prefix commands with numbers: `10j` moves down 10 lines.  
- Combine operators + motions: `d$` = delete to end of line, `y}` = yank paragraph.  
- Use `.vimrc` to persist preferred settings.
