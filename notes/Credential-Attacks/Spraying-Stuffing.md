# Spraying, Stuffing, and Default Credentials

Spraying, stuffing, and checking for default credentials are quick and effective ways to gain access.  
They target common weaknesses in authentication systems and are often overlooked by defenders.  

---

## Password Spraying

Spraying means trying **one password across many accounts**.  
This avoids account lockouts while still finding weak, org-wide passwords like `Spring2025!` or `Welcome123`.  

```shell-session
# Example: spray SMB logins with a known weak password
netexec smb 10.100.38.0/24 -u usernames.list -p 'ChangeMe123!'
```

- **When to use:** When you have a list of usernames but no passwords.  
- **Why it works:** Organizations often enforce complexity but users still pick predictable seasonal passwords.

## Credential Stuffing

Stuffing means reusing **username:password pairs** stolen or leaked from another system.  
This is effective if users reuse credentials across multiple services (e.g., corporate email + VPN).  

```shell-session
# Example: stuff known creds against SSH
hydra -C user_pass.list ssh://10.100.38.23
```

- **When to use:** When youâ€™ve already captured credentials from a dump, phishing, or another service.  
- **Why it works:** Credential reuse is one of the most common enterprise mistakes.

## Default Credentials

Many applications and devices ship with **vendor default logins**.  
If admins forget to change them, attackers can gain easy access.  

```shell-session
# Install and query default credentials cheat sheet
pip3 install defaultcreds-cheat-sheet
creds search linksys
```

- **When to use:** During enumeration of new services, especially network devices or legacy applications.  
- **Why it works:** Default creds are widely published and rarely rotated on older systems.
