# IMAP and POP3

## Common Attack Paths

### Enumeration

- [ ] Banner grab → `openssl s_client -connect <target>:143`
- [ ] Test plaintext login → `telnet <target> 143`
- [ ] Nmap scripts → `nmap --script=imap* -p143,993 <target>`

### Attack Paths

- Weak creds → brute force common accounts
- Cred reuse → mailboxes often store VPN/AD passwords
- Downgrade STARTTLS → capture creds in cleartext
- Exploits in old Dovecot/Courier servers

### Auxiliary Notes

- Look for creds inside inbox (VPN configs, password resets).
- IMAP/POP3 often tied to corporate AD accounts.
- Try both IMAP and POP3 — some hosts run both.
