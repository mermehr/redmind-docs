# Simple Mail Transfer Protocol

## Common Attack Paths

### Enumeration
- [ ] Banner grab → `nc <target> 25`
- [ ] VRFY/EXPN → `smtp-user-enum -U users.txt -t <target>`
- [ ] Test relay → `swaks --server <target>`

### Attack Paths
- Open relay → send spoofed mail
- User enumeration → valid usernames for brute force
- Weak creds → brute force or spray
- Exploits in mail server software (Exim, Postfix)

### Auxiliary Notes
- Good source of usernames in corp environments.
- Relay tests can be noisy; proceed carefully.
