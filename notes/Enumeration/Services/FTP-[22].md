# File Transfer Protocol

## Common Attack Paths

### Enumeration
- [ ] Check for anonymous login → `ftp <target>`
- [ ] Banner grab → `nc <target> 21`
- [ ] Recursive directory listing → `ls -R`
- [ ] Nmap NSE → `nmap --script=ftp* -p21 <target>`

### Attack Paths
- Anonymous login → file leaks / upload webshells
- Weak passwords → brute force via hydra/medusa
- Cleartext creds over network → sniff with Wireshark/tcpdump
- Exploits in old vsftpd / ProFTPD versions

### Auxiliary Notes
- Try uploading test files if permissions allow.
- Watch for writable web roots (easy shell).
- Passive vs active FTP can matter in firewalled labs.

### Common Commands

```bash

# Find NSE Scripts
find / -type f -name ftp\* 2>/dev/null | grep scripts

# Pilage all files
wget -m --no-passive ftp://anonymous:anonymous@10.129.14.136
```
