# Network File System

## Common Attack Paths

### Enumeration
- [ ] List exports → `showmount -e <target>`
- [ ] Mount exports → `mount -t nfs <target>:/share /mnt/share`
- [ ] Check permissions on mounted dirs

### Attack Paths
- Misconfigured exports with root access → full file R/W
- No root_squash → privilege escalation via root-owned files
- Credential files exposed in mounted directories

### Auxiliary Notes
- Good place to find SSH keys, configs, db creds.
- Even read-only exports may leak sensitive data.
- Be careful mounting as root — permissions can be tricky.

## General Enumeration

*Common Commands*

```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -p111,2049 -sV -sC
sudo nmap --script nfs* 10.129.14.128 -sV -p111,2049
```

*Show Available NFS Shares | Mount*

```bash
showmount -e 10.129.14.128
sudo mount -t nfs 10.129.14.128:/ ./target-NFS/ -o nolock

ls -n mnt/nfs/
ls -l mnt/nfs/
```
