# Notes

Ongoing and ever-changing notes from my penetration testing education, practice, and hands-on work.  

The purpose of including these notes is not to serve as a polished or finalized reference, but to document the progression of my learning journey in offensive security. They evolve as my workflow, understanding, and toolset expand.  

I’ve made these available in case some of the material here might be useful to others on a similar path. Please note that these notes are informal and may change frequently as I refine and update them.

All of these notes were written and structured by me, though much of the information (not all) comes from working through the [HTB Academy CPTS pathway](https://academy.hackthebox.com/preview/certifications/htb-certified-penetration-testing-specialist/where-to-start), which I’m still progressing through. I highly recommend it if you’re struggling — it’s a huge amount of material to take in. I attempted not to copy things verbatim; instead, I adapted the content, added steps where I felt something was missing, and shaped it into a structure that works for me. Take what’s useful, and hopefully it helps you too.

If I’ve unintentionally crossed into proprietary material, feel free to reach out and I’ll make corrections right away.
