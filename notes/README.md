# Notes Repository

This repository contains ongoing and ever-changing notes from my penetration testing education, practice, and hands-on work.  

The purpose of including these notes is not to serve as a polished or finalized reference, but to document the progression of my learning journey in offensive security. They evolve as my workflow, understanding, and toolset expand.  

Iâ€™ve made these available in case some of the material here might be useful to others on a similar path. Please note that these notes are informal and may change frequently as I refine and update them.
